# Water board Update {{plant name}}

Dear {{User name}},

Here is a plant summary of {{plant name}} for data between {{Data start date}} and {{Data end date}}. In total, we received **{{Number of data points}}**!

On average, operators were recording a data point every {{n points/Total collection time}. Our goal is a data point every hour, or approximately {{n points expected-n points total}} more than {{plant name}} already submits.

Congratulations, {{percent within norms Honduras}} of the data points report effluent water within Honduran drinking water regulations. The highest spike in raw water was {{max raw water}}, which was treated down to {{right after max raw water}}.

The following graph shows raw water, settled water and filtered water over the course of the month:

The next graph shows coagulant dosage:

The next graph shows the number of data points taken each day, to help determine when more data points should be collected. Ideally, there should be 24 data points every day, spaced about every hour.

Thanks for sending this data! This will help engineers back at Cornell design better treatment processes!
